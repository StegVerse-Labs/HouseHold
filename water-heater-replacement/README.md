# Water Heater Replacement – Household Project

This directory documents the failure, assessment, and replacement
planning of the home's primary water heater system.

Goals of this documentation:
- Maintain a factual, date-ordered record of events
- Separate observations from third-party findings
- Preserve warranty-relevant evidence
- Support inspection-compliant replacement decisions

The documentation is structured so that each party’s statements
and findings are recorded independently.
