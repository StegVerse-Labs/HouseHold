# Request for Cash Settlement / Alternative Fulfillment

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing in reference to the above claim regarding failure of the
electric water heater at my residence.

The unit has failed due to internal leakage and is no longer safe
to operate. Continued operation presents risk of water damage
and electrical hazard. This condition has been documented.

I have cooperated fully with the Choice Home Warranty claim process
and with the assigned service provider. However, the proposed
replacement includes a substantial list of items categorized as
“not covered,” resulting in out-of-pocket costs that materially exceed
the value of the covered repair.

These costs include, but are not limited to:
- Permit fees
- Disposal
- Expansion tank
- Pan
- Supply lines
- Piping modifications
- T&P discharge modification
- Difficult access surcharge

Additionally, physical access constraints at the installation location
make a like-for-like replacement unnecessarily risky and increase
the likelihood of inspection failure or further scope expansion.

I have obtained an independent estimate indicating that the system
can be replaced safely and code-compliantly at significantly lower
total cost when alternative configurations are permitted.

Under these circumstances, I respectfully request consideration of
one of the following resolutions:

1. Approval of an alternative, functionally equivalent replacement
   configuration (e.g., reduced-capacity tank with recirculation and/or
   tankless boosting), OR

2. A cash settlement reflecting the covered value of the claim,
   allowing me to pursue the safest and most practical replacement
   solution independently.

Either option would represent a reasonable, good-faith resolution
consistent with the intent of the policy.

I appreciate your review and look forward to resolving this matter
promptly.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
