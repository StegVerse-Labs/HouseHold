# Warranty Resolution Options

This document outlines reasonable resolution paths available
under the Choice Home Warranty agreement, based on documented
findings, contractor estimates, and safety considerations.

This document is intended to support a cooperative resolution
and does not constitute a demand or dispute filing.

---

## 1. Background

- The existing electric water heater has failed and is actively leaking.
- Continued operation is unsafe and has been documented accordingly.
- Warranty claim was opened in good faith and has proceeded through
  CHW-designated service channels.
- Multiple line items have been identified as “not covered,”
  resulting in substantial out-of-pocket cost.

---

## 2. Observed Coverage Discrepancy

Based on documentation and contractor communications:

Covered (per contract language and CHW communications):
- Water heater unit
- Labor for replacement
- Circulating pump (if applicable)

Not Covered (as billed by contractor):
- Permit fees
- Disposal
- Expansion tank
- Water heater pan
- Supply lines
- Piping modifications
- T&P discharge modifications
- Difficult access surcharge

The cumulative cost of non-covered items materially exceeds
the value of the covered portion.

## 3. Resolution Option A: Standard Replacement via CHW Contractor

### Description
Proceed with full replacement using CHW-selected contractor.

### Risks
- High out-of-pocket expense
- Open-ended scope expansion risk
- Inspection uncertainty due to access constraints
- No cost predictability

---

## 4. Resolution Option B: Alternative Equivalent Replacement

### Description
Approve an alternative configuration that:
- Uses a smaller tank water heater (30–40 gallons)
- Maintains recirculation capability
- Meets functional demand
- Improves safety and serviceability

### Advantages
- Lower installation risk
- Reduced labor complexity
- Increased likelihood of passing inspection
- Lower overall cost

---

## 5. Resolution Option C: Buyout / Cash Settlement

### Description
CHW provides a cash settlement equivalent to the covered
portion of the replacement.

### Advantages
- Immediate resolution
- Eliminates dispute over non-covered items
- Allows homeowner to pursue safest, code-compliant solution
- Reduces administrative burden for all parties

---

## 6. Good-Faith Basis for Buyout Consideration

- Independent contractor estimate indicates full replacement
  can be completed at materially lower cost.
- Permit office has confirmed minimal permit fee ($5),
  conflicting with billed amounts.
- Physical constraints make like-for-like replacement
  unnecessarily risky.
- Alternative solutions remain within contract-covered categories.

---

## 7. Requested Outcome

The homeowner requests consideration of:
- An alternative replacement configuration approval, OR
- A cash buyout reflecting the covered value of the claim

Either option represents a reasonable, cooperative resolution
consistent with contract intent and documented conditions.
