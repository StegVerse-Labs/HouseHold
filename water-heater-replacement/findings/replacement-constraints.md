# Replacement Constraints Assessment

This document summarizes the physical, safety, compliance, and cost
constraints affecting replacement of the failed water heater.

The intent is to document observed limitations and risks, not to
assign fault or dispute coverage.

---

## 1. Physical Space Constraints

- The existing water heater was installed at original construction (2019).
- Access clearance above the tank is extremely limited.
- Prior maintenance and modifications required difficult positioning
  and limited working angles, particularly at the hot water outlet.
- Reinstallation of a same-size (50 gal) tank presents increased risk
  of failed inspection or unsafe workmanship due to access limitations.

---

## 2. Access and Workability Constraints

- Original installation did not include shutoff valves on hot and cold
  lines; these were added post-construction by homeowner to improve safety.
- Soldering and mechanical work near the tank top is difficult due to
  cabinet and wall proximity.
- Contractors have cited “difficult access” as a billable line item,
  indicating acknowledged work constraints.

---

## 3. Safety Constraints

- The existing tank is actively leaking, indicating internal tank failure.
- Restarting or re-energizing the unit to perform system testing
  presents risk of:
  - increased leakage
  - electrical hazard
  - water damage
- As documented in `safety-assessment.md`, continued operation
  is not considered safe.

---

## 4. Inspection and Code Compliance Risk

- Replacing the unit with a same-size tank under constrained conditions
  increases likelihood of:
  - inspection failure
  - additional “code upgrade” charges
  - mid-install scope expansion
- Permit office has confirmed plumbing permit cost of $5,
  conflicting with contractor estimate of $150, suggesting
  administrative markup rather than jurisdictional requirement.

---

## 5. Cost Escalation Risk

- Warranty-associated contractor estimates include multiple line items
  categorized as “not covered,” totaling approximately $1,375.
- Independent plumbing estimate indicates full replacement
  at materially lower cost.
- Proceeding under warranty-selected installer exposes homeowner
  to unpredictable additional charges.

---

## 6. Summary

The combination of physical space limitations, safety concerns,
inspection risk, and cost escalation creates a strong case
for considering alternative replacement configurations
that meet functional requirements while reducing risk.
