# Alternative Replacement Plan

This document outlines viable replacement options that provide
equivalent or improved functionality compared to the existing system,
while addressing documented constraints.

The intent is to define reasonable, code-compliant alternatives
to a like-for-like replacement.

---

## 1. Functional Requirements

The replacement system must:
- Supply adequate hot water for a multi-bathroom household
- Support an existing recirculation loop
- Maintain user comfort and usability
- Meet local code and inspection requirements
- Reduce risk of future service complications

---

## 2. Baseline Configuration (Current)

- 50-gallon electric tank water heater
- Dedicated recirculation return line
- Watts recirculating pump
- Multiple sinks utilizing recirculation adapters
- Long overall piping run with short point-to-point distances

---

## 3. Option A: Reduced-Capacity Tank + Recirculation

### Description
- Install a 30–40 gallon electric tank water heater
- Retain existing recirculation pump and return loop

### Benefits
- Reduced physical size improves access and serviceability
- Lower installation risk under constrained conditions
- Faster recovery times relative to tank size
- Improved likelihood of passing inspection

### Considerations
- Reduced stored volume compared to original system
- May require operational adjustments during simultaneous high demand

---

## 4. Option B: Reduced-Capacity Tank + Tankless Booster

### Description
- Install a 30–40 gallon electric tank water heater
- Add a tankless electric water heater as an inline or point-of-use booster
- Retain recirculation for rapid hot water delivery

### Benefits
- Effectively increases usable hot water capacity
- Maintains comfort during peak demand
- Reduces need for large storage tank
- Allows modular servicing and future upgrades

### Considerations
- Electrical capacity must be verified
- Tankless unit may require dedicated circuit(s)

---

## 5. Compliance and Coverage Alignment

- Contract language indicates coverage for:
  - electric water heaters
  - tankless water heaters
  - circulating pumps
- Proposed configurations remain within covered appliance categories
- No increase in system complexity beyond typical residential standards

---

## 6. Cost Overview (Estimated)

- Reduced-capacity tank heater: lower equipment cost
- Reduced installation labor due to improved access
- Optional tankless booster still results in total cost
  below or comparable to warranty “not covered” charges
- Predictable pricing versus open-ended scope escalation

---

## 7. Summary

The alternative replacement configurations outlined above:
- Address documented physical and safety constraints
- Reduce inspection and cost risk
- Provide equivalent or improved functional performance
- Align with contract-covered system types

These options represent reasonable, good-faith alternatives
to a like-for-like replacement under constrained conditions.
