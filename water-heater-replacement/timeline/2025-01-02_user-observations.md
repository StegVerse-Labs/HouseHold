# User Observations – Jan 2, 2025

Observer: Homeowner

Findings:
- Active leakage observed from water heater tank
- Leak rate sufficient to prevent safe re-energizing of unit
- Continued operation presents risk of water damage and electrical hazard
- Existing recirculating pump previously replaced by homeowner (~5 years ago)
- Shutoff valves were added post-construction due to original absence
- Physical working space above tank is extremely limited

Conclusion:
The water heater is in a failed state and cannot be safely restarted
for testing without risk.
