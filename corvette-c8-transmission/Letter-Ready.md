Subject: Request for written attestation of transmission work and goodwill resolution  
Vehicle: 2023 Corvette Stingray 2LT Z51  
VIN: 1G1YB2D42P5117803

To the Service Management Team at Don Ringler Chevrolet
and GM Customer Care,

I am writing regarding my 2023 Corvette Stingray 2LT Z51 purchased in
December 2022 and serviced through Don Ringler Chevrolet in Temple, Texas.

In March 2023, the vehicle experienced a transmission failure while
operating on Interstate 35, approximately 100 miles from the dealership.
The vehicle was towed to Don Ringler Chevrolet and remained in dealership
custody from March 2023 until pickup in August 2023.

I appreciate that the transmission-related work was covered under
the factory warranty. However, I am requesting clarification and
goodwill consideration to close this matter accurately and completely.

Specifically, I request:

1) Written technical attestation of the work performed:
   - Whether the transmission was repaired or fully replaced
   - If replaced: the installed transmission part number, revision/model
     identifier, and whether the unit was new or remanufactured
   - Any available serial or identifier information for the installed unit
   - A copy of the complete repair order history, including open/close dates
     and internal notes

2) Clarification of service history records:
   - Explanation of any “normal maintenance” entries appearing on CARFAX
     during the March–August 2023 custody period
   - Confirmation that all service records accurately reflect the work performed

3) Goodwill consideration for loss of use:
   - The vehicle was unavailable for approximately five months
   - No comparable loaner vehicle was provided during this period
   - I incurred towing and loss-of-use impacts during the extended repair window

The vehicle is currently financed through USAA Federal Savings Bank,
and accurate service and component documentation is important for
ongoing ownership continuity, valuation, and future transfer records.

I am seeking to resolve this cooperatively and am not alleging wrongdoing.
My goal is to ensure accurate documentation of the work performed and to
address the significant loss-of-use period in a reasonable manner.

Please advise the appropriate point of contact to provide the written
attestation and to discuss goodwill resolution. I am happy to supply any
additional documentation needed.

Sincerely,

Rigel & Chelsie Randolph
