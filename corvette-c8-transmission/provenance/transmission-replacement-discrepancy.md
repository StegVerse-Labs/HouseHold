# Transmission Replacement Discrepancy

Purpose: Record discrepancies between what was performed vs what is documented.

## Facts reported by owner
- Owner was told the transmission model number installed is "new as of Aug 2023"
- This implies the replacement unit may not have been available at the time of purchase (Dec 2022)
- Repair documentation received does not explicitly state transmission replacement (verify by attaching the receipt)

## Evidence to attach
- Repair receipt(s): `attachments/docs/warranty-repair/`
- Any written communication from dealer/GM: `attachments/docs/warranty-repair/` or `attachments/docs/reports/`
- Photos of identifiers (if possible): `attachments/photos/`

## Open questions (to be answered with evidence)
- Was the transmission replaced entirely or repaired internally?
- If replaced: what is the part number and serial?
- Why does the repair order omit a clear replacement statement (if it does)?
- Was the replacement unit new, remanufactured, or updated revision?
