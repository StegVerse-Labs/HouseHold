# Storage Conditions During Dealer Custody

Purpose: Record storage/condition observations and evidence.

## Observations
- Owner has video evidence of vehicle stored outside dealership areas
  with visible dust/dirt accumulation consistent with extended outdoor storage.

## Evidence
- Videos stored at: `attachments/videos/`
- Add dates/timestamps for each file where possible.

## Why this matters
- Supports loss-of-use narrative (extended custody)
- Supports duty-of-care / bailment expectations (reasonable care in custody)
- Provides objective condition documentation
