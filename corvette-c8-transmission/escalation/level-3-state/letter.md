Subject: Consumer complaint – extended loss of use and documentation integrity  
Vehicle: 2023 Corvette Stingray Z51  
VIN: [INSERT VIN]

To the Texas Office of the Attorney General – Consumer Protection Division,

I am submitting this complaint regarding a warranty repair incident involving
my 2023 Corvette Stingray Z51.

In March 2023, the vehicle experienced a transmission failure while operating
on Interstate 35 and was towed to Don Ringler Chevrolet in Temple, Texas.
The vehicle remained in dealership custody from March 2023 through August 2023,
resulting in approximately five months of total loss of use.

While the transmission-related work was covered under warranty, the duration
of custody, lack of a loaner vehicle, and documentation inconsistencies
have not been resolved despite attempts at cooperative resolution with
the dealership and GM Customer Care.

I am requesting assistance to:
1) Obtain clear written attestation of the work performed (repair vs replacement),
   including part identification.
2) Ensure service-history records accurately reflect work performed.
3) Seek reasonable goodwill consideration for extended loss of use.

This complaint is supported by a documented timeline, custody record,
and retained evidence (videos, repair records, third-party service history).

Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]
