Subject: Request for written attestation of transmission work + goodwill remedy (2023 Corvette Stingray Z51)

To [SERVICE MANAGER NAME] and GM Customer Care,

I’m writing regarding my 2023 Corvette Stingray Z51 purchased in December 2022.

In March 2023, the vehicle experienced a transmission failure while operating on I-35, approximately 100 miles from the dealership. The vehicle was towed to your dealership for warranty diagnosis and repair and remained in dealer custody from March 2023 until pickup in August 2023.

I appreciate that the transmission work was covered under warranty. However, I am requesting two items to close this incident properly and to ensure accurate records for future ownership continuity:

1) Written attestation of the work performed:
   - Whether the transmission was repaired or replaced
   - If replaced: part number, revision/model identifier, and whether new or remanufactured
   - Any serial/identifier information available for the installed unit
   - The full repair order history (open/close dates and notes)

2) Goodwill consideration for the extended loss-of-use period:
   - The vehicle was unavailable for approximately five months
   - No loaner/alternate vehicle was provided (if applicable)
   - I incurred losses related to towing and loss of use

I also request clarification regarding service-history entries that appear during the custody period (e.g., “normal maintenance” shown on CARFAX) to ensure the service record accurately reflects what occurred.

Please let me know the best point of contact to provide the written attestation and to discuss goodwill resolution. I’m happy to provide any supporting documents needed and would prefer to resolve this cooperatively.

Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]
