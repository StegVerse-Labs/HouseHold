Subject: Request for corporate review — extended loss of use and documentation integrity  
Vehicle: 2023 Corvette Stingray Z51  
VIN: [INSERT VIN]

To GM Customer Care and Regional Service Management,

I am requesting corporate review of a warranty repair incident involving
my 2023 Corvette Stingray Z51 purchased in December 2022 and serviced
through Don Ringler Chevrolet in Temple, Texas.

In March 2023, the vehicle experienced a transmission failure while
operating on Interstate 35 and was towed to the dealership. The vehicle
remained in dealership custody from March 2023 until August 2023,
resulting in approximately five months of total loss of use.

While the transmission work was covered under warranty, the duration of
custody, absence of a loaner vehicle, and documentation inconsistencies
warrant review and goodwill consideration.

Specifically, I am requesting:

1) Written corporate attestation of the transmission work performed,
   including whether the transmission was repaired or replaced, and
   identification of the installed unit.

2) Clarification of service-history records, including CARFAX entries
   reflecting “normal maintenance” during the custody period.

3) Goodwill consideration for extended loss of use, including one or
   more of the following:
   - loss-of-use compensation
   - extended drivetrain warranty
   - written documentation suitable for future ownership transfer

I am seeking a cooperative resolution and accurate records rather than
dispute. Supporting documentation is attached for review.

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
