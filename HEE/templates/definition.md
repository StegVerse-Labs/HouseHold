# Household Escalation Engine

Most people lose consumer disputes not because they are wrong,
but because documentation fragments under stress.

The Household Escalation Engine (HEE) restores continuity by:
- preserving evidence
- separating responsibility from truth
- structuring escalation incrementally

HEE is not legal-tech.
It is procedural infrastructure for everyday life.

This repository contains anonymized case studies demonstrating:
- home warranty escalation
- automotive warranty escalation
- loss-of-use recovery
- documentation integrity restoration
