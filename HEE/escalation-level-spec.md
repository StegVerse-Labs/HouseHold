# Escalation Level Specification (HEE)

This document defines the **graduated escalation model** used by HouseHold.

Escalation is evidence-driven, not emotional.
Each level is independent, complete, and defensible on its own.

## Escalation Philosophy

- Escalation is a **tool**, not a threat
- Each level assumes the previous level *may fail*
- No level relies on future promises or goodwill
- Every claim must be traceable to evidence
