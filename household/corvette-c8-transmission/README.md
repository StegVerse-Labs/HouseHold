# Corvette C8 Transmission Incident

This project documents a transmission failure and extended repair/custody period
for a 2023 Corvette Stingray Z51 purchased in December 2022, including
documentation integrity concerns, custody timeline, and recovery avenues.

Goals:
- Preserve a factual timeline and evidence record (videos, photos, documents)
- Track custody and provenance independently
- Identify discrepancies (service documentation vs observed work performed)
- Prepare escalation-ready packets to request remedy (loss-of-use, goodwill, attestation)

This repository section is evidence-first and avoids speculation.
