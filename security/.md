# Security Policy (HouseHold)

HouseHold contains real-world incident packets and references to evidence.

## Do NOT commit
- Credentials, tokens, API keys
- Full addresses, account numbers, or sensitive IDs
- Anything you wouldn't want publicly searchable

## Evidence Safety
If you must store sensitive artifacts:
- Store a redacted version
- Prefer references and hashes over raw content
- Keep originals offline when possible

## Reporting
If you spot accidental sensitive data committed:
- Open an issue titled: **[security] accidental sensitive data**
- Do not paste the sensitive content into the issue
